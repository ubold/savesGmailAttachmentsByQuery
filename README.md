Sometime ago I needed to download bunch of photo attachments from my gmail. Unfortunately there were about 130+ emails, and photos in every single one of them. I was about run through every single email, then I googled how to quickly do this work, which lead me to Google Scripts. And here's the script I wrote to download bunch of photos from my email. Obv, not limited to photos. 


To Run: 

Create a new project on https://script.google.com/home 

Then paste, then give it your account's blessings (authenticate and give the script access to your gmail and drive), and run it.
